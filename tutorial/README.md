# Udapi tutorial

To run this tutorial, install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install.html) (or JupyterLab) and run `jupyter notebook` from  this directory.

Don't display the tutorial `ipynb` files on GitHub because it cannot render the collapsible Details, Hints and Solution sections, so you would miss important parts of the tutorial.
If you don't have Jupyter installed, you can display the tutorial with https://nbviewer.jupyter.org, using the following links:

- [01-visualizing.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/udapi/udapi-python/blob/master/tutorial/01-visualizing.ipynb)
