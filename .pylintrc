# Udapi project overrides some of the default pylint settings

[FORMAT]

# Maximum number of characters on a single line.
# Most of the code is in a method in a class, which adds 8 spaces,
# so with the default limit 79, there would be just 71 chars left.
# By increasing the limit to 100, I hope we improve the readability
# (we can afford more descriptive variable/method names,
# while not having to break too many lines.)
max-line-length=100
